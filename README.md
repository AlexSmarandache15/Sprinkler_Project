# Sprinklers_Project


Introduction<br />
It is considered "n" sprinklers installed to wet a horizontal strip of grass that is L meters long and l meters wide. Each sprinkler is centered vertically on the respective grass strip. For each sprinkler we know:
i) its position as the distance from the left end of the line that crosses horizontally the middle of the grass strip
ii) its operating radius.


Task<br/>
Determine the minimum number of sprinklers that must be turned on to water the entire strip of grass.
Implement 2 different algorithms, in C and Python, as well as the corresponding data generators.

Folder content<br/>

=== Folder Date ===<br/>
Contains data for 10 input sets and correct answers.
Each set of input data is copied to the source file from where the program extracts its input data.

=== Folder Algoritm1_C ===<br/>
It contains the implementation of the first algorithm for solving the requirement in the C language.

=== Folder Algoritm1VariantaPY ===<br/>
Contains the implementation of the first algorithm for solving the requirement in Python language.
The main program is main.py.

=== Folder Algoritm2_C ===<br/>
It contains the implementation of the second algorithm for solving the requirement in the C language.

=== Folder Algoritm2VariantaPY ===<br/>
Contains the implementation of the second algorithm for solving the requirement in Python language.
The main program is main.py.

=== Folder GeneratorDate_C ===<br/>
Contains the input data generator implemented in C.

=== Folder GeneratorDateVariantaPY ===<br/>
It contains the data generator implemented in Python, but the main data generator is the one in C.

=== RaportTehnic_Source Folder ===<br/>
It contains the source of the technical report, the corresponding PDF is outside the folder, written in Romanian..
