# Sprinkler_Project


Introduction<br />
It is considered "n" sprinklers installed to wet a horizontal strip of grass that is L meters long and l meters wide. Each sprinkler is centered vertically on the respective grass strip. For each sprinkler we know:
i) its position as the distance from the left end of the line that crosses horizontally the middle of the grass strip
ii) its operating radius.


Task<br/>
Determine the minimum number of sprinklers that must be turned on to water the entire strip of grass.
Implement 2 different algorithms, in C and Python, as well as the corresponding data generators.
